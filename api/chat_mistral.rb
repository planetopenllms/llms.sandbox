In the story, a supercomputer named Deep Thought calculates the answer after 7.5 million years of processing, but the characters are left puzzled because they don't know the actual *question* to which 42 is the answer.\n\nOf course, this is a humorous and philosophical take on the idea that some questions may not have simple or meaningful answers. In reality, the \"answer\" is often interpreted as a commentary on the absurdity of seeking definitive meaning in an unpredictable universe.\n\nWould you like a deeper dive into the philosophical implications, or are you just here for the meme? ðŸ˜„"},
